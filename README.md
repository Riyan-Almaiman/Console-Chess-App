# Chessapp
- My attempt at writing a console chess app on my own. The code is really messy and no one should look at it but if you want to try playing it and see where it breaks that'd help me :) I cant find where it would break yet

- Pawns dont turn into queens when they get to the end of the board and you cant have the rook switch spots with the king otherwise it *should* work fine in every situation but probably not

- I know the code is really unorganized and random I worked on this in the most disorganized way possible, for 3 days id quit and then the next day I'd come back and add more features randomly and fix random things in random spots so there might be a few lines that literally don't do anything. 

- The functions that check the possible moves and print red x's definitely should not be there and should be in a seperate class or something but it was a last minute add when i realized it was something easy to put in after writing the logic.

I already lost motivation to clean it up or fix it anymore but yeh I'm really satisfied that I actually wrote something functional on my own
